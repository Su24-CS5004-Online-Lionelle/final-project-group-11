### Search Button

On the top of the window, there is a box for user to type for searching and filtering. After typing the game name, click the `Search` button to search the information about the game and the result will be printed on the display area below buttons. All the game information are obtained through https://www.freetogame.com/api.

If the game is not available through the api, "No game found" will be printed on the display area.

### List Button

The `List` button locates on the right cornor of the second row of buttons. This button allows user to print out current game list to further edit the list.

At the beginning, the list should be empty.

After adding or filtering games, the `list` button will print out the most updated list to the display screen.

### Add and Add All Buttons

`Add` button locates on the first row of the buttons while `Add All` is on the second row. The difference between `Add` and `Add All` is that `Add` handles the situations when the user only needs to add a single game item (per time) to the game, while `Add All` will add all free games that are retrieved from the api database. 

![Screenshot 2024-08-04 190159](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb8ae186-7352-4fe3-b57b-c74638053282)

For example, if the user obtains all PC-based free games, and only needs to add one game, such as `Age of Wushu`, then the user needs to click `Add` button instead of `Add All`. Then the user can type in the name of game, in this case, `Age of Wushu`, in the pop-up window and click `OK`.
![Screenshot 2024-08-04 190712](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce9ec479-e622-49f4-b6f5-db8e01f4f095)
Then the information of `Age of Wushu` would be added to the game list.

If the user needs to add all PC-based free games, instead of using `Add` button to add games one by one, the user can click `Add All` button. After clicking, the display area will print `Done`.
![Screenshot 2024-08-04 191624](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7d5ca74-bf5c-4bef-beae-eb5ef7608166)

Then when the user need to display current game list, all the PC-based free games will be printed on the display screen.

### Remove and Remove All Buttons

`Remove` button is on the first row and `Remove All` button is on the second row. Similar to adding function, `Remove` is responsible for removing a single free game on the current game list and `Remove All` is responsible for removing all games on the game list. 

As demonstrated on above example, the user's current game list include all PC-based free games. If the user only needs to remove game `Pixel Worlds`, then the user needs to click `Remove` button, type `Pixel Worlds` and click `OK`.

After the game is successfully removed, the screen will print `Removed Game`. In this case, `Pixel Worlds` will not be on the list anymore.

If the user is sure about the genre name, then the user can choose `==` and click `OK`.
